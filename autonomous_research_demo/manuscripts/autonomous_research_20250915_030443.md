## Abstract

**Background**: GPU kernel optimization remains challenging, requiring deep expertise in parallel computing. We present an autonomous AI agent that learns optimization through self-supervised reinforcement learning.

**Methods**: Our agent uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhanced with contrastive learning to generate and evaluate CUDA kernels. The system analyzes its own training data to discover optimization patterns and generate scientific insights.

**Results**: Through 17 autonomous training steps, our agent achieved 3.76× maximum speedup with 100.0% success rate. Self-analysis revealed 3 distinct optimization patterns, generated 3 scientific insights, and formed 3 testable hypotheses.

**Conclusions**: AI agents can autonomously discover fundamental GPU optimization principles, demonstrating potential for independent scientific research in computational sciences.

**Keywords**: GPU optimization, autonomous AI, reinforcement learning, scientific discovery
