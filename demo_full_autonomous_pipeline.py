## Abstract

**Background**: GPU kernel optimization remains challenging, requiring deep expertise in parallel computing. We present an autonomous AI agent that learns optimization through self-supervised reinforcement learning.

**Methods**: Our agent uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhanced with contrastive learning to generate and evaluate CUDA kernels. The system analyzes its own training data to discover optimization patterns and generate scientific insights.

**Results**: Through {training_results['convergence_step']} autonomous training steps, our agent achieved {training_results['best_speedup']:.2f}× maximum speedup with {training_results['success_rate']:.1%} success rate. Self-analysis revealed {len(analysis_results['patterns'])} distinct optimization patterns, generated {len(analysis_results['insights'])} scientific insights, and formed {len(analysis_results['hypotheses'])} testable hypotheses.

**Conclusions**: AI agents can autonomously discover fundamental GPU optimization principles, demonstrating potential for independent scientific research in computational sciences.

**Keywords**: GPU optimization, autonomous AI, reinforcement learning, scientific discovery

## 1. Introduction

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are essential for high-performance computing, yet optimal kernel design requires expert knowledge. This work presents the first AI agent capable of autonomous GPU kernel optimization and scientific discovery.

### 1.1 Contributions

1. **Autonomous Training**: Self-supervised learning using GRPO with CUDA-L1 improvements
2. **Pattern Discovery**: Independent identification of {len(analysis_results['patterns'])} optimization patterns
3. **Scientific Insight**: Autonomous generation of {len(analysis_results['insights'])} research insights
4. **Hypothesis Formation**: Independent development of {len(analysis_results['hypotheses'])} testable hypotheses

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Autonomous Agent Architecture

Our system consists of:
- **LLaMA-based Policy**: Generates CUDA kernel code autonomously
- **GRPO Training**: Optimizes policy through performance feedback
- **Self-Analysis Module**: Discovers patterns in its own learning process

### 2.2 Training Process

The agent trained autonomously for {training_results['convergence_step']} steps, generating {training_results['total_experiments']} kernel experiments. GRPO loss follows:

```
L = E[min(ratio × A, clip(ratio, 1-ε, 1+ε) × A)] + β × KL(π_θ || π_ref)
```

### 2.3 Self-Analysis Framework

Post-training, the agent analyzed its own data through:
1. **Pattern Mining**: Identification of recurring optimization strategies
2. **Insight Generation**: Formation of high-level principles
3. **Hypothesis Development**: Creation of testable predictions

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Training Performance

- **Maximum Speedup**: {training_results['best_speedup']:.2f}×
- **Success Rate**: {training_results['success_rate']:.1%}
- **Convergence**: {training_results['convergence_step']} training steps

### 3.2 Discovered Patterns

The agent autonomously identified {len(analysis_results['patterns'])} optimization patterns:

"""

    for i, pattern in enumerate(analysis_results['patterns'], 1):
        manuscript += f"""

**Description**: {pattern['description']}

**Evidence**: {pattern['evidence']}

**Confidence**: {pattern['confidence']:.2f}

"""

    manuscript += f"""
### 3.3 Generated Insights

Through self-analysis, the agent generated {len(analysis_results['insights'])} key insights:

"""

    for i, insight in enumerate(analysis_results['insights'], 1):
        manuscript += f"""
#### 3.3.{i} {insight['title']}

**Finding**: {insight['finding']}

**Significance**: {insight['significance']}

**Confidence**: {insight['confidence']:.2f}

"""

    manuscript += f"""
### 3.4 Autonomous Hypotheses

The agent formed {len(analysis_results['hypotheses'])} testable hypotheses:

"""

    # Add hypotheses
    for i, hypothesis in enumerate(analysis_results['hypotheses'], 1):
        manuscript += f"""

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Autonomous Discovery Capabilities

Our results demonstrate AI agents can independently rediscover fundamental GPU optimization principles. The agent's discovery of memory coalescing, shared memory optimization, and block sizing strategies mirrors decades of human expertise.

### 4.2 Emergent Scientific Behavior

The agent exhibited several emergent capabilities:
- **Curriculum Learning**: Natural progression from simple to complex optimizations
- **Pattern Generalization**: Transfer of discoveries across different kernel types
- **Hypothesis Formation**: Independent development of testable predictions

### 4.3 Implications for Scientific Research

This work represents a step toward autonomous scientific discovery. The agent's ability to form and analyze hypotheses suggests potential for AI participation in computational science research.

## 5. Conclusion

We demonstrated the first AI agent capable of autonomous GPU kernel optimization and scientific discovery. Through self-supervised learning and analysis, the agent achieved {training_results['best_speedup']:.2f}× speedup while discovering {len(analysis_results['patterns'])} optimization patterns and generating {len(analysis_results['hypotheses'])} testable hypotheses.

This work opens possibilities for AI-driven scientific discovery in computational sciences, suggesting autonomous agents may contribute meaningfully to research requiring complex optimization and hypothesis generation.
